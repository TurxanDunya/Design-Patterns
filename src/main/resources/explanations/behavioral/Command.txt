WHAT IS COMMAND?
Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments,
delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

ADVANTAGES:
1. Makes our code extensible as we can add new commands without changing existing code
2. Reduces coupling the invoker and receiver of a command

DISADVANTAGES:
1. Increase in the number of classes for each individual command
