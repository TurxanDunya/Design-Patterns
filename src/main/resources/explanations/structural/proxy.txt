WHAT IS PROXY?
Proxy lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object.
A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or
after the request gets through to the original object.

WHY PROXY?
Protection - Control access to original object's operations
Remote - Provides a local representation of a remote object
Virtual - Delays construction of original object until absolutely necessary
Client is unaware of existence of proxy. Proxy performs its work transparently.

REAL LIFE EXAMPLES
Lazy loading of collections by hibernate, AOP based method level security,
Spring uses to provide support for features like transactions, caching and general AOP support.

DIFFERENCE FROM DECORATOR
Depending on type of proxy, it doesn't need real object all the time.
A decorator needs to have a real object for it to work.

Also purposes are different: While proxy provides features like access control, lazy loading,
auditing etc., decorator adds new functionality to existing functionality.
