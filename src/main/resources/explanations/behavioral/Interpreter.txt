WHAT IS INTERPRETER?
Interpreter pattern is used to defines a grammatical representation for a language and
provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.

In our example, we are creating an interface Expression and concrete classes implementing
the Expression interface. A class TerminalExpression is defined which acts as a main interpreter
and other classes OrExpression, AndExpression are used to create combinational expressions.
