WHAT IS COMPOSITE?
We have a parent-child or part-whole relationship or hierarchy of objects and
we want to be able to treat all objects in this hierarchy uniformly.
We can use composite pattern to simplify dealing with such object arrangements.

Goal of composite pattern is to simplify the client code by allowing it to treat to composites and
leaf nodes in same way.

REAL LIFE EXAMPLES
Composite is used in many UI frameworks, since it easily allows to represent a tree of UI controls.
Because, some pages are looks similar with small differences.

DIFFERENCE FROM DECORATOR
While Composite deals with tree structure of objects, Decorator simply contains another (single) object.
