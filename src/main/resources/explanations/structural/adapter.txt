WHAT IS ADAPTER?
Simply adapts an object to another interface without changing behaviour.

MORE...
We have an existing object which provides the functionality that client needs.
But, client code can't use this object because it expects an object with different interface.
Using adapter design pattern, we make this existing object work with client by adapting the object
    to client's expected interface.
This pattern is also called as "Wrapper", as it "wraps" existing object.

WHAT ABOUT, IF BOTH TARGET AND ADAPTEE CLASSES ARE CONCRETE?
In such situations, object adapter is the only solution.

IN REAL LIFE EXAMPLES:
- InputStreamReader
- OutputStreamReader

PITFALLS:
Class Adapter creates an object which exposes unrelated methods in part of your code, polluting it.
Avoid class adapter, as mush as possible!
