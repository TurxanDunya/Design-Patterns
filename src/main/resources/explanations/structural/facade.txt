WHAT IS FACADE?
Client has to interact with a large number of interfaces and classes in a subsystem to get result.
So client gets tightly coupled with those interfaces & classes. Facade solves this problem.

HOW?
Facade provides a simple and unified interface to a subsystem.
Client interacts with just the facade now to get same result.

DIFFERENCE FROM ADAPTER
While Facade intent is to simplify the usage of subsystem for client code,
Adapter is meant to adapt an object to different interface.
